## Part 4: Testing

Now that you completed most of the setup, let's make sure everything is working. You start by validating the account linking flow, then interact with the skill to create a voice code and access Salesforce data.

### Test the Linking Flow

1. Go to your Alexa app on your device (or go to https://alexa.amazon.com).
2. Click **Skills**. 
3. Click **Your Skills**.
4. Find the **Salesforce Demo** skill and click it.
5. Click **Enable**.

Your browser or device will then open a window to the Salesforce login screen. 
Enter your Trailhead Playground user credentials, and you should see a page letting you know your skill was successfully linked.

### Use the Skill

1. Try out the following request: “Alexa, open Salesforce Demo.”
2. Alexa will welcome you and ask you to create a voice code.
3. Choose a 4-digit code and speak it back.
4. Alexa will create the code and let you ask about your recent leads or opportunities.
5. Don’t forget to try changing your code!
6. If at any point you aren’t sure what else you can ask, just say “Help”.
